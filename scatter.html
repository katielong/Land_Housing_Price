      <h2>Land Price and Land Sales</h2>
      <p>Unlike most other countries, land in China is owned by the government. By limiting the amount of land available for sales each year, the government may be able to gain profit by pushing its transaction price. Thus comes the question: after controlling for urban population size and real per capita income, if there still exists a negative relationship between land sales and land price. In this visualization, the size of each circle shows population size, and color shows its corresponding income group. We categorized salary into four groups using its inter-quartile range. </p>
      <p>In general, both average land price and new land sales increased during 2008-2010, but started to shrink after 2010. Major cities clustered around lower-left corner in 2012 compared to 2007, but this was not so obvious among non-major cities. Among the non-major cities, we observed negative linear relationships between land sales and land price across most groups, but this negative relationship is not obvious in major city groups. </p>
